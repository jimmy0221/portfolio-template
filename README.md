```html
<div class="header__text-box row">
    <div class="header__text">
        <h1 class="heading-primary">
        <!-- Replace the following name with your name -->
        <span>Thomas White</span>
        </h1>
        <!-- Put a small paragraph about yourself -->
        <p>Backend Engineer based in the United States</p>
        <a href="#contact" class="btn btn--pink">Get in touch</a>
    </div>
</div>
```


For changing the screenshot:
- first place the image in `images/` folder and then in HTML replace the name in `src` with the name of your image.

- Recommended size for project image (1366 x 767px) also make sure the size of all  project images is the same.

```html
<img
    src="./images/name-of-your-image.png"
    class="work__image"
    alt="Project 1"
/>
```

### Clients Section

- Place the logos of the clients and companies that you have worked with in `images/` directory and then replace the name in `src` with the name of your logos accordingly.

- Make sure that you don't have whitespace on either side of the logos.

<img
    src="./images/your-logo.png"
    class="client__logo"
    alt="Your Logo"
/>
```
